I've created a simple calendar where you can upload a photo per day! You'll need to create your own account first!

## Objectives
- Models. Your app should have at least 3 models. Currently, 2 models as I had to implement the calendar
- Views. Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- Use Gems Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
  * Cloudinary
  * Simple Calendar - https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar
- User Login. Make sure you have basic authentication.
- Heroku. Deploy your code to Heroku.

## Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## To do
- [ ] Create a delete user function
- [ ] Add "New Post" to empty calendar cells
- [ ] Display posts without images in calendar cells
- [ ] Add a search function to search through posts and dates
- [ ] Allow only one photo per day
- [ ] Add a location for each post

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was my lack of planning beforehand. I didn't have a vision for my functionality or layout, just a very basic idea of what I wanted. This really slowed me down while building the site. For next project, I'll spend a day planning all the features and a basic layout so I can organise my time better.
